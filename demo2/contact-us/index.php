This was my first experience publishing a novel, and I appreciated his regular communication and education. The end quality of the art/ book cover and text formatting were very professional. My only frustrations were: (1) when I pointed out a few issues and in return received a message that the issues were corrected, but when I review it not all were addressed, and (2) when I had an expectation as part of the project and found later that it was not part of the deal. All said, I wouldn't hesitate to work with Amazon Publishing Pro's again.</p>-->
